# Frontmatter Reference

This documentation system takes a minimalist approach: focus on required metadata and let automation handle the rest.

## Required Properties

### title
- **Type:** `string`
- **Description:** Document title used in navigation and page headers
- **Usage:** Keep it descriptive and unique

```yaml
title: "Getting Started Guide"
```

### description
- **Type:** `string`
- **Description:** Short summary for SEO and previews
- **Usage:** Target 50–160 characters

```yaml
description: "Learn how to work with the documentation system."
```

## Automatic Features

Several metadata fields are derived automatically:

- **Navigation:** Previous/next links and categories from the directory structure
- **Ordering:** Numeric prefixes in file names (`01-`, `02-`, etc.)
- **Dates and authors:** Pulled from Git history
- **Sidebar entries:** Built from folder and file names

## File Organization

### Directory Structure

```
apps/<project-name>/src/content/docs/[version]/[lang]/[category]/[document].mdx
```

- Categories are detected from folder names  
- Ordering comes from numeric prefixes  
- Navigation follows file hierarchy

### Naming Pattern

```
01-getting-started.mdx
02-installation.mdx
03-configuration.mdx
```

### Standard Categories

- `01-guide/` – tutorials and onboarding
- `02-components/` – UI component documentation
- `03-advanced/` – advanced topics
- `04-reference/` – detailed reference materials

## Example

Recommended frontmatter for most documents:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Document Title"
description: "Short explanation of what this document covers"
---
```

## Best Practices

### Titles

- Be descriptive and keyword-rich
- Keep them concise
- Ensure uniqueness within a section

### Descriptions

- Aim for 50–160 characters
- Highlight outcomes (“Learn how to…”)
- Reflect what users will accomplish

### File Organization

- Use numeric prefixes for order
- Group related content in the same folder
- Stick to consistent naming conventions

## Additional Considerations

### Multi-language Support

Keep the same structure and frontmatter across languages:

```yaml
# Japanese version
---
title: "コンポーネント概要"
description: "利用可能なUIコンポーネントの完全ガイド"
---

# English version
---
title: "Component Overview"
description: "Complete guide to available UI components"
---
```

### Versioning

Use the same structure per version:

```yaml
---
title: "Basic Usage"
description: "Learn the fundamentals"
---
```

### Special Cases

Some pages may need extra context—use the same minimal fields:

```yaml
---
title: "Project Landing"
description: "Overview of the project's core features"
---
```

## Comparing Approaches

### Legacy (not used)

```yaml
---
title: "Document"
description: "Description"
order: 3
category: "guide"
categoryOrder: 1
prev:
  text: "Previous"
  link: "/prev-page"
next:
  text: "Next"
  link: "/next-page"
author: "Author"
pubDate: 2024-01-01
updatedDate: 2024-01-15
sidebar: true
toc: true
---
```

### Modern Minimal (recommended)

```yaml
---
title: "Document"
description: "Description"
---
```

The system now infers the rest:

- `order` and `category` come from the filesystem
- `prev` and `next` links are calculated automatically
- Author and date information come from Git history
- Sidebar and TOC behavior follows global settings

## Migration Guide

When moving from complex frontmatter to the simplified format:

1. Keep only `title` and `description`
2. Use directory structure and prefixes to control order/category
3. Remove `order`, `category`, `author`, and date fields
4. Test navigation to confirm everything renders correctly

This approach reduces maintenance overhead while preserving essential metadata.

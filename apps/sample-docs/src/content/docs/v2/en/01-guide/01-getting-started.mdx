# Documentation Fundamentals

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation guide! This section teaches you everything you need to create, edit, and manage documentation effectively.

## What You'll Learn

In this comprehensive guide you'll discover:

- **Document Creation**: How to create new documents with the proper structure
- **Content Organization**: Best practices for organizing and categorizing content
- **Component Usage**: How to use built-in UI components to enhance your documentation
- **Advanced Features**: Automation, customization, and deployment strategies

## Documentation Philosophy

Good documentation should be:

1. **Clear and Concise**: Easy to understand and follow
2. **Well-Organized**: Logical structure and navigation
3. **Comprehensive**: Covers all necessary topics
4. **Maintainable**: Easy to update and keep current
5. **Accessible**: Available to all users regardless of ability

## Getting Started Checklist

Before you begin creating documentation, ensure you have:

- [ ] **Development Environment**: Node.js 18+, pnpm, and a code editor
- [ ] **Project Understanding**: Familiarity with the project structure
- [ ] **Content Plan**: Clear idea of what you want to document
- [ ] **Audience Awareness**: Understanding of who will read your documentation

## Project Structure Overview

`sample-docs` is managed as one application inside the libx monorepo. The directories you'll edit most often live here:

```
apps/sample-docs/
├── astro.config.mjs                 # Project-level Astro configuration
├── src/
│   ├── config/project.config.json   # Version, language, and category translations
│   ├── content/docs/
│   │   ├── v1/en/01-guide/...
│   │   └── v2/en/<category>/<page>.mdx
│   └── env.d.ts, etc.
├── public/sidebar/                  # Navigation JSON generated by build:sidebar
└── package.json                     # Used with `pnpm --filter=sample-docs ...`
```

Shared packages (`packages/ui`, `packages/content-utils`, and others) live at the repo root, so the app can reuse UI and utilities without owning its own `src/lib`.

### Frequently Used Commands

After `pnpm install`, the fastest way to work on sample-docs alone is to run the following from the repo root:

```bash
# Start the dev server for this project only
pnpm --filter=sample-docs dev

# Regenerate the sidebar after changing the doc structure
pnpm build:sidebar

# Build only sample-docs
pnpm build:selective --projects=sample-docs
```

## Key Features

### Automatic Sidebar Generation
The documentation system automatically generates sidebar navigation based on your content structure and frontmatter configuration.

### Multi-language Support
Content can be created in multiple languages with automatic language switching and URL management.

### Component Integration
You can call Icon, Tabs, Alert, and other components from the `@docs/ui` package directly within MDX.

### Version Management
Combine `apps/sample-docs/src/config/project.config.json` with `scripts/create-version.js` to safely maintain multiple documentation versions.

## Content Creation Workflow

The typical workflow for creating documentation involves:

1. **Planning**: Define the scope and structure of your content
2. **Creating**: Write the initial content using Markdown and MDX
3. **Enhancing**: Add components, examples, and interactive elements
4. **Organizing**: Set up proper categories and navigation
5. **Testing**: Verify links, formatting, and functionality
6. **Publishing**: Deploy and make available to users

## Writing Guidelines

When creating documentation:

- **Start with the user's goal**: What are they trying to accomplish?
- **Use clear headings**: Create a logical hierarchy of information
- **Include examples**: Show, don't just tell
- **Be consistent**: Use the same terminology and formatting throughout
- **Test everything**: Verify that instructions actually work

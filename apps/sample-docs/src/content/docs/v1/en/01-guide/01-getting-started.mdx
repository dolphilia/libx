# Documentation Versioning Overview

Welcome to the sample documentation project! This page explains the versioning structure used inside the libx monorepo and shows how versions like v1 and v2 coexist.

## Versioning in libx

Each application stores documentation under `apps/<project-name>/src/content/docs/<version>/<lang>/`. The UI is generated from `project.config.jsonc`, which describes versions and languages.

Sample structure for `sample-docs`:

```
apps/sample-docs/
├── src/
│   ├── config/project.config.jsonc   # Centralized version/language definitions
│   └── content/docs/
│       ├── v1/
│       │   └── ja/01-guide/...
│       └── v2/
│           ├── ja/
│           └── en/
└── public/sidebar/                  # Auto-generated sidebar JSON
```

The `versioning.versions` section in `project.config.jsonc` controls IDs, names, release dates, and which version is marked as latest. Running `node scripts/create-version.js sample-docs v3` generates every language/category structure automatically when you need a new version.

## Why Keep v1 and v2?

- **Visible migration plans**: Maintain v1 while building v2 so users can migrate gradually.
- **Stable URLs**: `/docs/sample-docs/en/v1/...` and `/docs/sample-docs/en/v2/...` stay distinct, which helps both readers and search engines.
- **Translation control**: Track translation progress per version, leverage rollback features in `scripts/add-language.js`, and restore content from `.backups/`.

### Version 1 (this page)

- **Goal**: Provide a quick overview of the versioning model  
- **Contents**: Directory layout, config files, core commands  
- **Audience**: Anyone new to the libx documentation layout

### Version 2 (main docs)

- **Goal**: Deliver end-to-end guidance on creating, editing, and automating docs  
- **Contents**: Guides, components, advanced topics, references  
- **Audience**: Editors actively working on `sample-docs`

## Languages and Sidebar

`sample-docs` uses locale-first URLs (`/docs/sample-docs/<lang>/<version>/...`). Passing `pathPattern: 'locale-first'` to `getSidebarAsync` from `@docs/content-utils` generates per-language, per-version sidebar JSON (for example `apps/sample-docs/public/sidebar/sidebar-en-v2.json`).

## Operating the Versioning System

1. **Parallel updates without structural drift**: Copy the v1 category structure to v2, then extend v2 as needed.
2. **Edit configs safely**: Prefer scripts such as `scripts/create-version.js` or `scripts/add-language.js` so changes are backed up automatically.
3. **Regenerate navigation**: Run `pnpm build:sidebar` after adding versions or categories, then confirm behavior with `pnpm dev --filter=sample-docs`.

## Next Steps

The latest v2 guides cover the hands-on workflows:

- **[Documentation Fundamentals](/v2/en/01-guide/01-getting-started)** – Review core principles shared across apps
- **[Creating Documents](/v2/en/01-guide/02-creating-documents)** – Learn the creation script workflow
- **[Version Management](/v2/en/01-guide/05-version-management)** – Understand how `project.config.jsonc` and automation work together

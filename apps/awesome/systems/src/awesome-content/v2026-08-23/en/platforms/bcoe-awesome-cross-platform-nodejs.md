# Cross-Platform Node.js<a id="awesome-cross-platform-nodejs-logo"></a>

Tools and guides for writing Node.js code across operating systems, including development environments, CI, compatibility layers, and libraries for OS detection, shells, files, and processes. Known issues cover Windows Unicode output and differences in process execution.

The platform support, free tiers, and known issues below reflect the fixed source snapshot. Current availability, maintenance status, and service terms have not been checked.

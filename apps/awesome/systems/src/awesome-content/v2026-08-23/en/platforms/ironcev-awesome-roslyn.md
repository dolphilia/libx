# Awesome Roslyn<a id="contents"></a><a id="contribute"></a><a id="license"></a>

[Roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn), officially the [.NET Compiler Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Compiler_Platform), provides open-source compilers and code analysis APIs for C# and Visual Basic .NET. Find books, tutorials, projects, analyzers, code fixes, refactorings, testing frameworks, source generators, articles, and talks. Versions, quantities, and product claims reflect the fixed source.

## Books

- [Roslyn Succinctly](https://www.syncfusion.com/ebooks/roslyn) - Free e-book by Alessandro Del Sole. Explains Roslyn APIs, then focuses on writing analyzers and refactorings.
- [.NET Development Using the Compiler API](https://www.apress.com/la/book/9781484221105) - Book by Jason Bock. Covers analyzers, refactorings, the scripting API, and reflections on the future of the Compiler API.
- [Roslyn Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/roslyn-cookbook) - Book by Manish Vasani, a member of the Roslyn analyzers team. After covering analyzers, refactorings, and scripting in detail, the book goes in-depth explaining how to develop new C# language features and contribute to the Roslyn source code.
